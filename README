This repository holds some proof of concepts for solving classification problems 
in urban aerial and panoramic images


1. Image modeling with keras:

* `land use`: multi class image classification with the EuroSAT dataset
* `building footprints`: instance segmentation with Massachusetts dataset
* `panoramic views`: multiclass instance segmentation with CamVid

2. Image modeling with pytorch:
